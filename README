For testing: 15.156.205.154 will act as coordinator (arbitrary, just copy coordinator.py to whichever machine you want). Workers will serve from port 8082 by default. 
If you change parameters in any file, remember to push updates using the deploy script. 
To test on a small subset of machines, `use serverlist.txt`. To test on all machines, use `fullserverlist.txt`

To deploy: 
- from scripts folder on laptop, `./deploy.sh`

To start: 
- `ssh -i [your private key] [username]@15.156.205.154` <- use this window to monitor coordinator output
- from scripts folder on laptop, `./start.sh`

To shutdown: 
- from scripts folder on laptop, `./shutdown.sh`
